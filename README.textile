h2. What is Project Euler?

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context."

Here i give some possible solutions to Project Euler problems.
Sometimes it's possible to find an even better solution.
I don't want to take away from you the joy that is to find the solution to a problem. So use this at your own risk ;).

Cheers.
